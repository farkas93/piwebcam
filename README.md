# Picamera 2 for Bookworm 64-bit with Docker

I set up a docker container with the latest debian bookworm for using it with picamera2 and open-cv.

Credits to [hyzhak](https://github.com/hyzhak/pi-camera-in-docker/tree/main) for giving a good template on that matter.
The main diference is that he is basing his container on bullseye.
